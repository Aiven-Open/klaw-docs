## What's new in Klaw 2.5.0

### Redesigned screens with React UI

In this release, we have redesigned some key user interfaces using React
to enhance user experience and provide a more intuitive design:

- Features

- New React UI: Topic Overview including capabilities to
  - Review topic details
  - Edit and promote topics
  - Create and promote new schemas
  - Add and review subscriptions (ACL) for the creation and retrieval of passwords
  - See history to provide an audit trail of the topic
  - See messages to view Kafka events on the topic
  - Add and edit documentation (now: "Readme") in markdown format
  - Claim topics

- New React UI: "Request new..." button
  - Allows creating a new topic, subscription, schema or Kafka connector from everywhere in the new UI

- Import previously exported data back into Klaw
- Support for High Availability Caching

To disable the preview for the new Klaw user interface, open the
`application.properties` file on the Klaw **core** module, and set the
value of the following property to `false` (Effective from version 2.4.0, it
is true by default):

    #Enable new Klaw user interface
    klaw.coral.enabled=false

:::note
We are taking an incremental, feedback-driven approach in rolling out
the new Klaw interfaces. By providing the feature flag to preview the user
interfaces, we would like you to share your valuable
[feedback](https://github.com/aiven/klaw/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=03_feature.md).

### Connector configuration encryption

This release introduces password encryption for fields in connector configuration.
The fields that are encrypted can be configured in the application.properties file.

### Editable Topic Requests

This release adds the ability to edit your topic requests to fix mistakes instead of deleting and recreating a whole new request.

### Key dependency updates

Kafka client upgrade to 3.5.1
Spring upgrade to 3.1.2

### Identify Schemas deleted from Schema Registry

The superadmin can now use the "Schemas From Cluster" functionality to identify Schemas that have been deleted from the Schema Registry.
