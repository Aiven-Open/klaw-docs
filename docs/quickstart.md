# Quick Start

In this tutorial, we will install Klaw with docker, and request for a Apache KafkaÂ® topic and verify its existence on Apache Kafka
cluster.

## 1. Run the docker script

```bash copy-button
docker run -d -t -i -e KLAW_CLUSTERAPI_ACCESS_BASE64_SECRET="dGhpcyBpcyBhIHNlY3JldCB0byBhY2Nlc3MgY2x1c3RlcmFwaQ==" -p 9343:9343 --name klaw-cluster-api aivenoy/klaw-cluster-api:nightly --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway &&
docker run -d -t -i -e KLAW_UIAPI_SERVERS=http://host.docker.internal:9097  -e KLAW_CLUSTERAPI_ACCESS_BASE64_SECRET="dGhpcyBpcyBhIHNlY3JldCB0byBhY2Nlc3MgY2x1c3RlcmFwaQ==" -e KLAW_QUICKSTART_ENABLED=true -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL="jdbc:h2:file:/klaw/klawprodb;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;MODE=MySQL;CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS=TRUE;" -p 9097:9097 --name klaw-core aivenoy/klaw-core:nightly &&
docker run -d -t -i -p 2181:2181 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -e ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes --name klaw-zookeeper bitnami/zookeeper:3.8 &&
docker run -d -t -i -p 9092:9092 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -e KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=host.docker.internal:2181 -e ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://host.docker.internal:9092 --name klaw-kafka bitnami/kafka:3.3 &&
docker run -d -t -i -p 8081:8081 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -e SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KAFKA_BROKERS=PLAINTEXT://host.docker.internal:9092 --name klaw-schema-registry bitnami/schema-registry:latest
```

This script basically creates Klaw, Apache Kafka and schema registry processes, and also configures Apache Kafka and schema
registry servers in Klaw.

## 2. Login to Klaw

After docker has started 5 processes, you may verify them by `docker ps`.
Now you may log into Klaw on `http://localhost:9097` with
credentials `william : welcome` <!--vale NO_SPELL-->

## 3. Topics Catalog page

After logging in you will be redirected to our brand-new feature rich React UI.

You can "Request new Topic" from the top right corner, or you can select the dropdown "Request a new" to view all your
options.

![Screenshot Topics page, displaying a list of topics in the system. The page indicates that the user is viewing a preview of the redesigned user interface and provides a link to revert to the old interface. The page includes filter options for team and environment, search bar for topic names, and buttons for requesting new topics and approving requests. A message indicating that no topics match the current criteria is displayed.](../static/images/quickstart/AfterLogin.png)

## 4. Request for topic

![Screenshot Request form, inviting to request a new topic. The page prominently displays a "Request a New Topic" button and includes instructions on how to request a topic. The page also includes a disclaimer informing users that they are viewing a preview of the redesigned user interface and provides a link to revert to the old interface.](../static/images/quickstart/RequestForTopic.png)

Fill in the details

- Select STG environment
- Fill in a topic name <!-- vale off -->"testtopic" <!-- vale on -->for example
- Leave partitions, replication factor and advanced configuration to defaults
- Fill in text a topic description. 'Topic for demo' for example
- Submit

This will create a topic request for your team member to approve.

## 5. View your request

Newly created topic request is now visible in **My team's requests** menu on the sidebar

![Screenshot "My team's requests" page. There is a tab navigation that shows links to Topics, Acls, Schema and Connector requests. Currently, "Topics" is active, so there is a filterable and searchable table with topics. The table prominently displays key information about each topic, including its name, environment, ownership, status, and request-related details.](../static/images/quickstart/MyRequest.png)

## 6. Logout

On the top right click on the profile and again click on the profile -> logout

william <!--vale NO_SPELL--> is now logged out.

## 7. Login again

Now login with credentials `jennifer : welcome`

## 8. Go to Approve requests page

From the menu, click on "Approve requests" menu.

## 9. Approve request

Here there is a pending request to be approved or declined. Click on view to review and approve it.

![Screenshot: "Approve request" page.There is a tab navigation that shows links to Topics, Acls, Schema and Connector requests. Currently, "Topics" is active, so there is a filterable and searchable table with topics. Each topic request is displayed with its topic name, environment, ownership, status, request type, requested by, and requested on details. There is a button to view details, and buttons to approve or decline requests.](../static/images/quickstart/ApproveReq.png)

## 10. That's it. Topic is created on Apache Kafka cluster

To verify

```copy-button
docker exec -it klaw-kafka /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

should display the newly created Apache Kafka topic. You can also try creating a schema for the topic from the "Request a new"
dropdown.
