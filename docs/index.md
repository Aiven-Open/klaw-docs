# Klaw Documentation

Klaw consists of two components:

- The main Klaw Core application handling governance, security and meta storage.
- The Klaw Cluster API handling the connections to the Apache KafkaÂ®,
  Apache Kafka Connect and schema registry servers.

## Quickstart

We're providing a docker script that you can copy and run. It installs Klaw, Apache Kafka, and schema registry servers as docker processes. [**Go through the quickstart guide**](./getting-started/quickstart).
