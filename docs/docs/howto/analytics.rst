Analytics
=========

It is important to get an overview of your teams/tenants requests, activity log, cluster status etc.

From the Analytics screen, you can view few charts about requests from your teams, topics, consumer groups and acl ownership etc.

These statistics differ if you login as a USER role or SUPERADMIN (tenant overview) role.
