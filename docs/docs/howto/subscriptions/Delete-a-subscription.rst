Delete a subscription
=====================
To delete a subscription in Klaw, you need to create a delete subscription request.

Create a delete subscription request
------------------------------------
Once a subscription is created in an environment, it is possible to delete the subscription from the environment.

1. In Klaw, select **Topics** on the navigation bar.
2. Choose the specific Kafka Topic where the subscription you wish to delete is located.
3. Select the red **X** on the right-hand side of the topic by the environment table at the top of the page.

.. note::
   This request can be raised by subscription team owners and approved by the same team.

4. Confirm that you are sure you wish to delete the topic from the environment.
5. A delete subscription request is created, which can be approved or declined by an approver from your team in the **Approvers** view.
