Edit a Topic
============
Changing the configuration to a topic over it's lifetime is a common and sometimes unavoidable task. Klaw makes this easier by providing the ability to edit an existing topic.

1. In Klaw, select **Topics** on the navigation bar.
2. Select the specific Kafka Topic you wish to edit.
3. Click the edit button on the right side of the Topic by Environment view (visible only on the lowest environment).
4. On the **Edit Topic** view, you can modify advanced configuration or change the *Partitions* and *Replication factor*.

.. note::
   See all advanced Topic configuration options in `Apaches documentation <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs>`_ or Select the 'i' button beside an advanced configuration entry to be taken directly to that entry in the Apache documentation.

5. Make all the changes to existing configuration and/or add additional configuration.
6. Make changes to existing configuration or add additional configuration.
7. Submit the configuration update request by selecting **Submit Update**.
8. A Request to update the topic with the new configuration is created, and a member of your team will be able to approve or decline the request in their **Approvers** view.
