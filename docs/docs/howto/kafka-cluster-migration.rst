Klaw supports synchronization to and from Klaw and the Apache KafkaÂ® and other clusters. This is found under the Synchronize menu item.

Synchronize either topics or ACLs from the cluster to Klaw if you have a new Klaw setup with existing data platforms.

Synchronize to the clusters if your Klaw setup is in place (for example, restored from backup, or unaffected by a cluster outage), this will reinstate the topics and/or ACLs on the clusters.
