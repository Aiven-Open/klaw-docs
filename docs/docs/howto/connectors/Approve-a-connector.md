# Approve connectors

When a connector request is made, a team member, other than the creator
of the request, can review and either approve or decline it.

## Approve a connector request

1.  When you login into Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending
    Requests**. Select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to the **Approve**
    tab and select on **Connector Requests** to view the requests that
    need approval.
2.  Review all information related to the connector request and approve
    it by selecting the tick button while viewing the pending connector
    requests.
3.  The connector will immediately attempt to be provisioned on
    approval.

the connector details in Klaw.
