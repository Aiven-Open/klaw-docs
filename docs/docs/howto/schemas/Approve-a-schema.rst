Approve Schema
==============
When a schema request is made, a team member other than the request creator can review and approve or decline the request.
Requests can only be submitted by topic owner team, and approved by the same team.

Approve a request
------------------

1. Upon login to Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending Requests**. To view them, select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to **Approve** and select **Schema Requests** to view the pending requests.
2. Review all information related to the request and approve it by clicking the tick button while viewing the pending schema requests.
3. The schema will immediately attempt to be provisioned upon approval.

.. note::
   In the event of any issue in the schema creation, the request will remain in the approvals view for re-approval once the issue is resolved.


Declining a request
-------------------

1. Upon login to Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending Requests**. To view them, select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to **Approve** and select **Schema Requests** to view the pending requests.

Reviewing a request

The request contains various fields to help the approver make an informed decision and keep an audit record of the request and the schema details within Klaw.


.. note::
   The request creator cannot approve their own request and will not be listed as an approver.
