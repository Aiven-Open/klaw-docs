Manage users
============

Klaw maintains users stored in its metadata. However, :doc:`authentication <./authentication>` can be different based on configuration.
Every user is associated to a team, and a role. User can switch between multiple teams, if 'switch teams' flag is enabled for the user.

User Signup
-----------

In the home page of Klaw, there is an option for a user to signup.
