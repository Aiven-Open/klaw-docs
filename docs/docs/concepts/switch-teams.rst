Switch Teams
============

Klaw allows users to switch between teams.

- User profile always has a base team, and a list of teams which can be switched to.
- Switch teams list should always contain the base team
- User can switch teams with a drop down provided in the Klaw portal - header section.
- Switching to a different team, updates the base team of the profile.
- This provides users some flexibility to users when creating or approving requests by switching team
- Get a different Dashboard/Analytics/ActivityLog and more relevant views-
- Only a superadmin with 'ADD_EDIT_DELETE_USERS' permission can enable a user profile to switch teams

.. note::
   Any request raised cannot be approved by the same user in Klaw.
