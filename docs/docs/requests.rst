Request and approval
====================

One of the biggest benefits of working with Klaw is that it adds governance to
your Apache KafkaÂ® landscape as it grows.  When a new topic, schema, ACL or
connector is needed, developers **request** that item themselves.  Another
member of the same team can then **approve** the request, and the item will be
created.

.. note:: Only holders of the ``USER`` role can make requests; users with the ``SUPERADMIN`` role cannot make requests, but can manage users and teams.
