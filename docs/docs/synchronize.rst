Synchronize Metadata
====================

Klaw supports synchronization to and from Klaw and the Apache Kafka and other clusters. This is found under the **Synchronize** menu item.

* Synchronize either topics or ACLs **from** the cluster to Klaw if you have a new Klaw setup with existing data platforms.

* Synchronize **to** the clusters if your Klaw setup is in place (for example, restored from backup, or unaffected by a cluster outage), this will reinstate the topics and/or ACLs on the clusters.
