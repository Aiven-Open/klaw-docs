# Manage schema

When a schema request is made, a team member other than the request
creator can review, approve, or decline the request. Schema requests can
only be submitted by the topic owner team and approved by the same team.

## Approve a schema request

1. When you log into Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending
   Requests**. Select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to **Approve** and
   select **Schema Requests** to view the pending requests.
2. Review all information related to the request and approve it by
   selecting the tick button while viewing the pending schema requests.
3. The schema will immediately attempt to be provisioned on approval.

   :::note
   If there is any issue with the schema creation, the request will remain
   in the approvals view until the issue is resolved.
   :::

## Decline a schema request

1. When you log into Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending
   Requests**. Select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to **Approve** and
   select **Schema Requests** to view the pending requests.
2. Review the information associated with the topic request and decline
   it by clicking the **X** button.
3. Provide a reason for declining the request.
4. The request will be declined, and the creator will receive an email
   with your reason for declining the request.

## Review a schema request

When reviewing a schema request, various fields help the approver make
an informed decision and keep an audit record of the request and the
schema details within Klaw.

:::note
The request creator cannot approve their own request and will not be
listed as an approver.
