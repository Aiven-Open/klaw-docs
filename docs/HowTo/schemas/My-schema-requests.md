# My Schema Requests

To access the **My Schema Requests** page, navigate to the **Requests
-\> My Schema Requests** section. On this page, you can view all the
requests that you have created, as well as an audit log and history of
your schema requests.

The requests are listed in chronological order based on the _Date
Requested_, with the most recent request at the top and the oldest at
the bottom. Additionally, on this page, you can find any request you and
your team have made and its current status.

## Filtering the requests

For easy navigation use the dropdown to filter the requests which you
are viewing by the status of the request.

- **all**  
  View all requests that your team has created.

- **created**  
  View all requests that have been created but are yet to be reviewed, approved, or declined. These are your active
  requests which are yet to be actioned.

- **deleted**  
  View all the requests that you have deleted. These are the requests which have been withdrawn from review and that
  will never be actioned.

- **declined**  
  View all the requests that an approver has declined. These are requests which will never be actioned.

- **approved**  
  View all the requests you have submitted that have been approved and actioned.
