# Approve connectors

When a connector request is made, a team member, other than the creator
of the request, can review and either approve or decline it.

## Approve a connector request

1.  When you log into Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending
    Requests**. Select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to the **Approve**
    tab and select on **Connector Requests** to view the requests that
    need approval.
2.  Review all information related to the connector request and approve
    it by selecting the tick button while viewing the pending connector
    requests.

3.  The connector will immediately attempt to be provisioned on
    approval.

    If there are any issues during the connector creation, the request will stay in the approvals view for re-approval once the problem is resolved.

## Decline a connector request

1.  When you log into Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending
    Requests**. Select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to the **Approve**
    tab and click on **Connector Requests** to view the pending
    requests.
2.  Review the information associated with the connector request and
    decline it by clicking the **X** button.
3.  Provide a reason for declining the request.
4.  The request is declined, and the creator will receive an email with
    your reason for declining the request.

## Review a connector request

The connector request provides multiple fields that assist the approver in making a well-informed decision. These fields also maintain an audit trail of both the request and the connector's details within Klaw.

:::tip
The request creator cannot approve their request and will not be listed as an approver.
