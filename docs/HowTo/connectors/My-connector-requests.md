# My Connector Requests

You can access the **My Connector Requests** page by navigating to
**Requests -\> My Connector Requests**. On this page, you can view all
the requests you have created, as well as an audit log and history of
the connector requests created by your team.

The requests are listed in chronological order based on the *Date
Requested*, with the most recent request at the top and the oldest at
the bottom. Additionally, on this page, you can find any request you and
your team have made and its current status.

## Filtering the requests

are viewing by the status of the request.
