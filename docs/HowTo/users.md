# Manage users

Klaw stores user information in its metadata, and the method of
[authentication](./authentication) may
vary depending on the configuration. Each user is associated with a team
and a role, and if the **Switch teams** flag is enabled, they can switch
between multiple teams.

## User signup

To sign up for a user account in Klaw, you can access the option on the
