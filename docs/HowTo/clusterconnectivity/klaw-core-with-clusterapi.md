# Connect Klaw Core and Klaw Cluster APIs

To run Klaw successfully and perform all the necessary operations on a Kafka cluster, you must connect the Klaw APIs (
Core API and Klaw Cluster API). This involves configuring the secret key and SSL protocols in the
respective `application.properties` files and verifying the connectivity between the APIs.

You can find the `application.properties` file located in the following paths:

- Core: [klaw/core/src/main/resources]
- Cluster-API: `klaw/cluster-api/src/main/resources`

## Configure Klaw application.properties file

1.  Configure the secret key

    The secret key is a base64-encoded string configured in the
    `application.properties` files for Klaw's `core` and `cluster-api`
    modules. An example secret key is as follows:

    ```java
    klaw.clusterapi.access.base64.secret

    Example: ``dGhpcyBpcyBhIHNlY3JldCB0byBhY2Nlc3MgY2x1c3RlcmFwaQ==``
    ```

2.  Configure the SSL settings to enable HTTPS

    To enable HTTPS for Klaw, you need to configure the following SSL settings in the `application.properties` files for
    the Klaw Core API and the Klaw Cluster API:

    ```java
    server.ssl.key-store=client.keystore.p12
    server.ssl.trust-store=client.truststore.jks
    server.ssl.key-store-password=klaw1234
    server.ssl.key-password=klaw1234
    server.ssl.trust-store-password=klaw1234
    server.ssl.key-store-type=pkcs12
    ```

    The `key-store` and `trust-store` settings specify the location of
    the keystore and truststore files, respectively, while the
    `key-store-password`, `key-password`, and `trust-store-password`
    settings specify the passwords for accessing these files. The
    `key-store-type` setting specifies the type of keystore that is
    being used, which in this case is `pkcs12`.

    :::note
    Make sure that the certificates used in the keystore and truststore
    are signed by the same CA, or the public keys of both stores must be
    imported into each other's trust stores.

3.  Verify the successful connection

    In the Klaw user interface, go to the **Dashboard -\> Settings**
    page, and look for the `klaw.clusterapi.url` configuration. To use a
    secure connection, update the URL to HTTPS, for example:

         https://localhost:9343

    Save the change and click **Test connection**.

If everything is configured correctly, you can perform all the necessary operations with Klaw. However, if you encounter
any issues, you can check the logs or troubleshoot the configuration to fix the problem.
