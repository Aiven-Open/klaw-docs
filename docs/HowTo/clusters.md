# Manage clusters

In Klaw, clusters are used to store the connectivity information of
servers. There are three types of clusters that you can define in Klaw:

<!-- vale off -->

- Apache Kafka
- Schema Registry
- Apache Kafka Connect
<!-- vale on -->

Depending on the type of cluster, you can need to configure various
settings, such as protocol, bootstrap servers, REST API URLs, and Apache KafkaÂ®
flavors.

need to log in using a SUPERADMIN account or an account with the
`ADD_EDIT_DELETE_CLUSTERS` permission.
