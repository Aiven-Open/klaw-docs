# Manage subscriptions

When a team member makes a subscription request, it must be reviewed and
approved or declined by another team member. This applies to producer
and consumer subscription requests, regardless of whether the topic
owner team or another team made them. The topic owner team always makes
the final decision.

## Approve a subscription request

1. When you log into Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending
   Requests**. Select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to **Approve** and
   select **ACl Requests** to view the pending requests.
2. Review all information related to the request and approve it by
   clicking the tick button while viewing the pending topic requests.
3. The subscription will immediately attempt to be provisioned on
   approval.

:::note
If there are any issues in the subscription creation, the request will
remain in the approvals view for re-approval once the issue is resolved.

## Decline a subscription request

1. When you log into Klaw, a pop-up will notify you of **Pending
   Requests**. Select **Yes, show me!** or navigate to **Approve** and
   select **Acl Requests** to view the pending requests.
2. Review the information associated with the topic request and decline
   it by clicking the **X** button.
3. Provide a reason for declining the request.
4. The request will be declined, and the creator will receive an email
   with your reason for declining the request.

## Review a subscription request

When reviewing a subscription request, various fields are available to
help the approver make an informed decision and to keep an audit record
of the request and the subscription details in Klaw.

:::note
The request creator cannot approve their own request and will not be
listed as an approver.
