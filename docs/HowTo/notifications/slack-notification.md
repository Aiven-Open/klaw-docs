# Slack Notifications

Slack notifications can be sent to users when actions are performed in
Klaw that requires their attention in lieu of email notifications.

## Configure Slack notifications

Slack notifications can be very easily configured in Klaw by following the simple steps outlined by Slack to enable email forwarding to a Slack channel or an individuals Direct Messages.

Slack has a helpful article on configuring email forwarding to slack [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/help/articles/206819278-Send-emails-to-Slack#)

As part of the configuration slack will give you a new email address that can replace the users email address in the User Configuration to send directly to their Direct Messages or it can replace the team email if you want to send it to a particular channel.

To see how to configure your users email addresses see our documentation on users [here](../users.md) or learn how to change the team email [here](../teams/manage-teams.md)
