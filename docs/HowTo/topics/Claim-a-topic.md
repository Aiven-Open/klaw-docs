# Claim a Topic

A Topic, over its life cycle, can exist for a long time, and in that
time, it is possible that teams will change and their priorities and
missions will change. To facilitate this, Klaw provides the ability for
a team to **Claim** a topic. This allows another team to take ownership
and administer the topic.

Follow these steps to claim a topic:

1. In Klaw, select **Topics** on the navigation bar.
2. Select the specific Kafka Topic you wish to claim.
3. A **Claim Topic** button will be available on the top right of the
   Topic by Environment view.

   :::note
   This option will only be available on topics your team does not own.
   :::

4. Confirm you wish to claim the topic.
5. This will create a single request to claim the topic across all
   environments
6. The existing owning team will see the request in their **approvers**
   view and be able to approve or decline the request.
