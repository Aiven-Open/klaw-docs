# Analytics

The Analytics screen on Klaw lets you track important information about
your teams, tenants, and cluster status. From the Analytics screen, you
can view various charts that provide information on requests from your
teams, topics, consumer groups, and ACL ownership.

The data available will vary depending on whether you are logged in as a
USER or a SUPERADMIN (tenant overview) role. Additionally, you have the
option to download a detailed report of the statistics.
