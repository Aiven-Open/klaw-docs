# Manage Roles and permissions

In Klaw, user permissions are determined by the roles they are assigned.
Each role corresponds to a set of specific actions a user is authorized
to perform within the system.

Klaw provides two default roles: **USER** and **SUPERADMIN**.

- The **USER** role is given a set of default permissions, which
  include the ability to request and approve topics, ACLS, and schema
  connectors.
- The **SUPERADMIN** role comes with default permissions that enable
  adding teams, users, clusters, and environments and performing all
  administrative operations within the system.

In addition, a SUPERADMIN has the authority to modify or add any role
and its associated permissions, providing greater flexibility in
managing roles and permissions within Klaw.
