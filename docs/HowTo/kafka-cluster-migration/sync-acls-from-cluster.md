# Synchronize ACLs from cluster

To synchronize ACLs from an Apache KafkaÂ® cluster with Klaw metadata, use
this procedure, which entails retrieving the ACLS (Producers &
Consumers) from an existing Apache Kafka cluster and assigning them to a team
in Klaw.

## Prerequisites

1. **Environment configuration**: Make sure that the `klaw.tenant.config` property is set up as described in
   the [tenant configuration](tenant-config.md) documentation.
2. **User permissions**: Log in with a user account with either `SUPERADMIN` or `SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS` permissions.

## Steps to synchronize ACLs

1. Navigate to the **Synchronize** menu and select **ACLs from Cluster**.
2. Choose one or more ACLs from the list, assign them to a team, and select **Save**. The selected ACLs
   will now appear on the topic overview page, assigned to the chosen team.

The list is organized into columns that display the topic name, partitions, replication factor, team, and a brief description. A search bar allows users to filter the list of topics based on specific criteria. There is a select element to filter the table by environment.](../../../static/images/sync/SyncAclsFromCluster.png)

3. To view all existing ACLs, whether assigned to teams or not, select the **Show all** option. This will display all
   Apache Kafka ACLs, both assigned and unassigned to any teams.

Following the above steps, you can synchronize ACLs from an Apache Kafka cluster with Klaw metadata.
