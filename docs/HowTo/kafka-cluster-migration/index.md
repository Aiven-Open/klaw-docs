# Kafka Cluster Migration

Klaw supports data synchronization between Klaw and Apache Kafka® and
other clusters. This can be accessed through the Synchronize menu
option.

## New Klaw installation 
Suppose you're setting up a fresh Klaw environment with pre-existing data on other clusters. In that case, Klaw allows for the seamless synchronization of topics and Access Control Lists (ACLs) from those clusters into your new setup.

## Existing Klaw environments
If your Klaw instance is already up and running—restored from a backup or unaffected by a cluster outage—you can leverage the `Synchronize` option to reinstate or update topics and ACLs across clusters, ensuring data consistency and uninterrupted operations.
