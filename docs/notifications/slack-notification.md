# Slack notifications

Stay updated with Slack notifications in Klaw. Instead of traditional email alerts, receive timely notifications directly in your Slack channels or direct messages (DMs).

## Configure Slack notifications

Configuring Slack notifications in Klaw is straightforward. Follow the steps provided by Slack to enable email forwarding to a specific Slack channel or individual DM:

1. Visit Slack's official guide on [sending emails to Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/help/articles/206819278-Send-emails-to-Slack#).
2. As part of the setup, Slack provides a unique email address.
3. Use this email address in Klaw:
   - Replace a user's email address in the [User Configuration](../user-team-management/manage-users.md) to send notifications directly to their DMs.
   - Alternatively, replace the team email to forward notifications to a specific channel. For more information, see [Managing Teams](../user-team-management/teams/manage-teams.md).
