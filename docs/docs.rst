Klaw consists of two components:

* The main application
* The Cluster API that handles the connections to the Apache Kafka, Apache Kafka Connect and Schema Registry services.

There are two main ways to run Klaw, choose the setup path that best suits your needs:

* :doc:`Run with Docker<docs/run-docker>`
* :doc:`Run from Java source<docs/run-source>`

Once you are up and running, use the guide for next steps: :doc:`docs/get-started-kafka`
