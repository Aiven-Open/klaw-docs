# Klaw installation

Klaw can be installed and configured in two ways:

- [Run from Docker](run-docker.md)
- [Run From Source](run-source.md)

Once Klaw is installed, you can use the [Configure Klaw wizard](configure-klaw-wizard.md) to configure your Apache
KafkaÂ®
cluster and start managing your Apache Kafka resources.
