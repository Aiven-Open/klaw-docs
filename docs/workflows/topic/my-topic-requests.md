# My topic requests

The **My Topic Requests** page can be accessed through the **Requests
-\> My Topic Requests** navigation bar. You can view all requests
created by you here. This page also provides an audit log and a history
of the topics and configuration requests created by you.

The requests are displayed in chronological order by 'Date Requested'
with the most recent request at the top and the oldest request at the
bottom. Additionally, on this page, you can find any request you and
your team have made and its current status.

## Filtering the requests

For easy navigation use the dropdown to filter the requests which you
are viewing by the status of the request.

- **all**  
  View all requests that your team has created.

- **created**  
  View all requests that have been created but are yet to be
  reviewed, approved, or declined. These are your active requests
  which have yet to be actioned.

- **deleted**  
  View all the requests that you have deleted. These are the
  requests which have been withdrawn from review and which will
  never be actioned.

- **declined**  
  View all the requests that an approver has declined. These are
  requests that will never be actioned.

- **approved**  
  View all the requests you have submitted that have been approved
  and actioned.
