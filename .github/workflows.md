# Overview GitHub workflows

This document explains how and why we organize our workflows for a CI strategy using GitHub actions.

## Directories and file structure

Our directory structure is as follows:

- üìÅ `/workflows` contains GitHub workflow files

## Pipeline

When a Pull Request is opened targeting `main`, these workflows are triggered:

- [`pull-request`](./workflows/pull-request.yaml)
  - runs linting and code / markdown formatting checks
- [`link-check`](./workflows/link-check.yaml)
  - checks that internal links are correct
- [`vale`](./workflows/vale.yaml)
  - spell checking
