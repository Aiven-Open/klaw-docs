Features
========

Kafkawize is built with the key features as below:

-   4 eyed principle â€“ Requesting and Approving topics/acls/schemas
-   Browse Acls,  Producers and Consumers
-   Synchronize Source of truth with Meta store
-   Support for Cassandra or an Rdbms

Security
--------
There is no security applied on Cluster Api. End points are exposed to anyone who can reach the host., and swagger is enabled too. Users can directly post/get requests to this application.

On the UI Api, Spring security is enabled. As the application boots, it loads all the users from database/cassandra into its memory and would be referred to it.

Security on the Kafka Broker is out of scope for Kafkawize., and it should be handled by you., however for Kafkawize to connect to Kafka broker, Acls/AdminClient properties need to be provided to avoid authorization issues.

Teams and Role Management
-------------------------

Kafkawize comes with 3 mains roles

-   USER
-   ADMIN
-   SUPERUSER

'User' has the rights to request and browse data

'Admin' has the all the rights as USER and approve all requests

'Superuser' has all the rights as ADMIN and synchronize cluster data with metadata. For ex : assign a team to a topic or acl.

A team can have multiple users with the above roles. Depending on the role of a user, he is authorized to perform the relevant actions on the portal.
User receives an authorization error if he/she performs an action if not authorized to.
